# Responsive Personal Portfolio Website

## Another one
I'm still learning the ropes and I'm getting better.
Na [YSF](https://github.com/hakeemyusuff) cut me soap ooo!!! 

YSF brought this out and I rocked with it.

In my eyes this is 90% responsive for all screen sizes ranging between a galaxy fold cover display and a 1440px wide display

## Lesson learnt
* DOM manipulation (How to render HTML using Javascript)
* CSS specifity
* CSS selectors (I learned how to use the first descendant selector, It saved me having to write too many
  class names and ID's)
* I actually used swiper js, Swiper JS is actually built with vanilla js, so I technically didn't use a library.
* How to make better descisions.
* How write CSS in general.
